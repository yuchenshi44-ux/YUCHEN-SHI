  <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> [你的姓名]</p>

  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>The goal of the 100SMILES Dental Care website is to increase the number of new patient bookings by 30% within 3 months of launch. This will be achieved by making key information (services, promotions, booking channels) easily accessible to target audiences, while also improving patient engagement through actionable oral health resources. Additionally, the site will reinforce the clinic’s reputation as a trusted, community-focused dental provider (with 3+ decades in Razole and 50+ years of collective staff experience) to build credibility and drive long-term patient retention.</p>

  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>1. <strong>Booking Conversion Tracking</strong>: Monitor the number of new patient bookings generated via the website’s email booking channel (admin@100smilesdentalcare.com.au) by comparing monthly booking volumes pre-launch (baseline) and post-launch. A 30% increase in monthly new bookings will indicate goal achievement.<br>
  2. <strong>User Engagement Analytics</strong>: Track two key metrics via website analytics: (a) Average time spent on high-priority pages (Services, Promotions, Oral Health Resources) – target: 2+ minutes per page; (b) Conversion rate of users who click from the Promotions page to the Contact/Booking section – target: 15%+ conversion rate.<br>
  3. <strong>Patient Feedback Survey</strong>: Send a short post-visit survey to new patients (via email) asking: “Did the 100SMILES website help you decide to book an appointment?” A target of 80% “Yes” responses will confirm the site’s relevance to user needs.<br>
  4. <strong>Resource Utilization</strong>: Track the number of views for oral health articles (e.g., “The Importance of Regular Dental Check-ups”) – target: 50+ unique views per article in the first month, indicating successful patient engagement.</p>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p><strong>1. Specific Target Audience Groups</strong><br>
  - <strong>Primary Group</strong>: Parents of children aged 3–12 in Razole and surrounding Queensland areas (e.g., nearby suburbs). These are typically 28–45-year-old working adults who prioritize child-friendly, compassionate dental care and value convenience (e.g., weekend trading hours).<br>
  - <strong>Secondary Group</strong>: Adults aged 25–55 in Razole seeking preventive care (check-ups, cleanings) or cosmetic/restorative dentistry (implants, orthodontics). This group is tech-savvy (uses mobile devices for healthcare research), time-constrained, and looks for transparent pricing/promotions.</p>
  
  <p><strong>2. Audience-Specific Design Adaptations</strong><br>
  - For parents of young children: 
    - Add a “Pediatric Dental Care” subsection on the Services page with details like “child-friendly staff” and “first-visit guidance” (e.g., “We help kids feel comfortable with gentle, playful explanations”).
    - Highlight weekend trading hours (8:30am–1pm) prominently on the Home and Contact pages, as parents often schedule appointments outside work/school hours.<br>
  - For busy adults (25–55):
    - Use bullet points to simplify service descriptions and promotion terms (e.g., “20% off first visit – book via email”) for quick scanning.
    - Add a sticky “Book Now” button (linked to the clinic’s email) on all pages, ensuring one-click access to booking.
    - Optimize the site for mobile (responsive design) – 70% of this group accesses healthcare websites via phones, so text size (minimum 16px) and button size (44x44px) will be adjusted for easy tapping.<br>
  - For both groups:
    - Use warm, reassuring language (e.g., “compassionate care” “trusted by the Razole community”) to align with their priority of finding a reliable dental provider.
    - Include professional photos of staff (on the Our Team page) to build trust and familiarity.
  </p>

  <h2>Site Flowchart</h2>
  <div class="flowchart-container">
    <!-- 流程图占位符：请将生成的PNG文件命名为"100smiles-flowchart.png"并与plan.html放在同一文件夹 -->
    <img src="100smiles-flowchart.png" alt="100SMILES Dental Care Site Flowchart" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <p class="flowchart-note">Flowchart Notes: 
      - Each box represents one page; box labels match page filenames (index.html = Home, services.html = Services, etc.).
      - Navigation order: Home → Services → Our Team → Promotions → Oral Health Resources → Contact Us.
      - External links: "Book Now" buttons link to admin@100smilesdentalcare.com.au (email client), and Contact Us page includes a Google Maps embed for the clinic address (33 Fantail St, Razole).
      - Use https://app.diagrams.net/ to create the flowchart: Add rectangular boxes for each page, connect with arrows (direction = navigation flow), and save as PNG.
